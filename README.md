# Color-Identifier

This project focuses on color classifying by K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning Classifier which is trained by R, G, B Color Histogram. 

If you want to classify more color or improve the accuracy you should work on the training data or consider about other color features such as Color Moments or Color Correlogram.
